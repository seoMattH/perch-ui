Perch UI Customizations

This project allows a Perch CMS user to change the default dashboard to a different look and feel.

In order for this project to work you will need to follow these instructions

1) Copy file carbonFiber.png from this folder and add it to your images directory.  I add it it to the following location in my project /_images/_ui/ .  If you have a different naming convention for you images folder outside of Perch then you will need to change the background image url in the CSS file newui.css .  I utilize this background in 4 different locations in the CSS file so you will need to change the location for all 4 places

2) Copy the files newui.css & _config.inc to the following directory in your perch cms directory.  perch/addons/plugins/ui/

3) That is all that needs to be done and you should now have a different dashboard for your clients.

4) I'm hopeful other Perch users will make changes to make this CSS file and or background image a better UI experience.  So I'm open to any and all suggestions.
